# hashMap

A JavaScript hash map activity from theodinproject. It showcases a HashMap class that has the following methods:

- **hash(key)**: Takes a key and produces a hash code with it. It uses a polynomial rolling hash with base 31 and modulo capacity.
- **set(key, value)**:  Takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. It also features doubling the capacity of the hash map when it exceeds its load capacity. 
- **get(key)**: Takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.
- **has(key)**: Takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- **remove(key)**: Takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.
- **length()**: Returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- **clear()**: Removes all entries in the hash map.
- **keys()**: Returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
- **values()**: Returns an array containing all the values.
- **entries()**: Returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]

## hashSet

This repository also features a hash set which only stores keys instead of keys and values. Its methods are copied from the HashMap class, removing sections where value is included.
